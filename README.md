# Salary_hike_prediction
We have made the model of employee salary hike by their years of experience. We have done this using simple linear regression and machine learning in python.

. Problem Statement: -

The head of HR of a certain organization wants to automate their salary hike estimation. The organization consulted an analytics service provider and asked them to build a basic prediction model by providing them with a dataset that contains the data about the number of years of experience and the salary hike given accordingly. Build a Simple Linear Regression model with salary as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models.

Run the code file and copy the path of dataset into it.
